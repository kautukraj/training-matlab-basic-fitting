ðŸŽ“ Assignment
==============

We are given a bunch of bi-dimensional data stored in a [file](./data.tsv).

Fill in the [MATLAB script](./estimate.m) to find out the coefficients of the **polynomial estimator** that best fits the data.

To complete the assignment do:
1. [Generate][1] a copy of this repository into your own account. Tick in the option "include all branches" âœ”
1. [Create the branch][2] `solution` off of the branch `assignment`.
1. [Commit][3] your version of the script as well as the generated image `out.png` into the branch `solution`.
1. [Push][4]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request][5] (**PR**) with `assignment` as _base branch_ and `solution` as _compare branch_.
1. [Request to review your PR][6] ðŸ‘‹ to turn in the assignment.
